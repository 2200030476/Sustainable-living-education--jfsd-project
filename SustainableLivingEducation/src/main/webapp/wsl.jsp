        <h2>Why Sustainable Living?</h2>
        <p>
            “A sustainable lifestyles approach is not a one-size-fits-all approach – it is a mentality and a filter that should be applied differently within different contexts.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The Sustainable Lifestyles Education Hub aims to provide users with learning pathways into exploring and understanding the topics and themes of sustainable lifestyles. The portal introduces users to the pertinent issues related to sustainable lifestyles; explores how our daily activities have direct connections with achieving sustainable development; and shares many resources that may be used to dive deeper into these topics.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The Challenge Ahead:</strong><br>
            Understanding what contributes to creating sustainable lifestyles is not an easy task. There are many factors that influence the sustainability of our daily practices, and there are several criteria that must be taken into account. Not least, a sustainable lifestyle must be:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Environmentally responsible</li>
            <li>Socially just</li>
            <li>Economically fair</li>
            <li>Ethically based</li>
            <li>Resource efficient</li>
            <li>Maintainable for future generations</li>
            <li>Resilient, adaptive, and future proofed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            While increasing fossil fuel usage and its resulting carbon emissions often overshadow other forms of material consumption, the environmental impacts and habitat destruction caused from the harvesting and extraction of these other resources have devastating impacts on the planet’s ecosystems and biodiversity.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a world of finite resources and planetary boundaries, this growing need for material consumption is a key factor that must be addressed if we are to achieve a more sustainable path to development (see SDG 12).

        <p>
            <strong>More Consumption Does Not Mean More for All:</strong><br>
            While levels of material consumption have increased dramatically, the inequalities in access to basic resources have also significantly intensified. On average, the richest countries consume 10 times as many resources per capita as the poorest countries. In fact, the material consumption level in the lowest-income countries has not significantly changed over the past 30 years.
